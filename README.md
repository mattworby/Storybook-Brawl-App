Storybook-Brawl-App

This application has been built entirely in ElectronJS. It was built to augment the experience of players of an indie game called "Story Book Brawl" made by Good Luck Games.

The purpose of the application is to display the entire set of cards within a UI that is easy to navigate as well as the display the previous "brawls". The app is not complete and still need a couple of UI adjustments before full deployment.

The full set of cards was pulled from a JSON database that is free online and the application sorts them on certain properties.

The previous "brawl" function operates by pulling a lot of information from logs that are located in the locallow folder for the game.
